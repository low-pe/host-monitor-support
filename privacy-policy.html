    <h1>Privacy Policy for HostMonitor</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 11, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>HostMonitor ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <h3>Data We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <p>HostMonitor does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our servers. We do not have any servers or backend infrastructure. The App operates entirely on your device.</p>

    <h3>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
    <p>The following information is stored locally on your device using iOS Keychain and UserDefaults:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>vast.ai API Key:</strong> Stored securely in iOS Keychain (encrypted by Apple)</li>
        <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Your preferences such as auto-refresh intervals and notification settings</li>
        <li><strong>Discord Webhook URL:</strong> If you choose to configure Discord notifications, stored securely in iOS Keychain</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device except when the App uses it to communicate directly with vast.ai's servers or your Discord webhook.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>vast.ai API</h3>
    <p>The App communicates directly with vast.ai's API servers to retrieve your hosting data. This communication includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your vast.ai API key (read-only)</li>
        <li>Requests for your machine status, earnings, and account information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is sent directly from your device to vast.ai. We do not intercept, store, or have access to this information. Please refer to <a href="https://vast.ai/privacy">vast.ai's Privacy Policy</a> for information about how they handle your data.</p>

    <h3>Discord (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you choose to configure Discord webhook notifications, the App will send notification messages directly to your Discord webhook URL. This is entirely optional and under your control. Messages include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Machine rental status updates</li>
        <li>Earnings summaries</li>
        <li>Machine offline alerts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These messages are sent directly from your device to Discord's servers. We do not store, intercept, or have access to these messages. Please refer to <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Discord's Privacy Policy</a> for information about how they handle webhook data.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your API keys and webhook URLs are stored using iOS Keychain, Apple's secure credential storage system. This data is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encrypted by iOS</li>
        <li>Protected by your device passcode or biometric authentication</li>
        <li>Only accessible by the HostMonitor app</li>
        <li>Backed up to iCloud in encrypted form (if you have iCloud Keychain enabled)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data. All communication happens directly between your device and the third-party services you choose to use (vast.ai and optionally Discord).</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>HostMonitor does not use any analytics services, tracking tools, or advertising frameworks. We do not track your usage of the App.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. However, since we don't collect any information at all, this is not a concern.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view your stored API key and settings within the App</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You can delete your API key and settings at any time through the App's settings</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> You can manually copy your API key and settings if needed</li>
        <li><strong>Complete Removal:</strong> Uninstalling the App removes all stored data from your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>HostMonitor's approach to privacy can be verified by examining the source code. We encourage transparency and welcome review of our data handling practices.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
